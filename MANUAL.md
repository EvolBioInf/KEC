# KEC Manual

## Introduction

## Principle of operation

## Installation
KEC does not require installation. Binary executables for Windows, Linux and macOS can be downloaded from Releases section. After download and extraction the software works in any directory. During download and first run the software can be marked by antivirus as harmul. However, if downloaded from this repository, the program only works as stated, without any malicious activity or data collection. Users may inspect and compile from source code, if security is a concern.

## Command-line parameters

## K selection

## Input and output data
KEC currently works only with fasta formated files on both input and output. To work with other formats (e.g. fastq) the file has to be converted to fasta first by any available tool. KEC also accepts whole directory as an input, where files with extensions `.fasta` `.fna`, `.ffn`, `.faa` and `.frn` are used. Direct support for other formats will be added in future versions.
